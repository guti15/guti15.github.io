	Hello, fellow techies I' am currently a Junior in college, in the mist of obtaining a bachelors degrees in Computer Science.  As a current student I'm  constantly found learning or meeting deadlines in projects and have discovered that I really enjoyed tinkering with computers in my spare time.  Some of the languages, that I have learned so far are C++ and Python.  As well as Mark-up languages like HTML along with it's friendly companion CSS.  There are many more languages, that I am currently striving to get a hold of, but for the mean time, I have developed a strong passion for the text editor EMACS.  It truly is a POWERFUL tool, and I am able to comprehend when  people say that it is similar to an OS.  It's functionality seem endless. As a Spanish speaker and currently studying natural language processing, I have came with the idea to develop my own version of tutorial for Emacs. While reasearching Natural Language Processign  I noticed that I truly enjoyed using my text editor because of it flexibility and ease to integrate to everything I was doing.  So decided to type up a small documentation of Emacs in Spanish. Done of course in Emacs itself. When I sensed the lack of information of this text editor in Spanish I felt obliged to spread the wealth of information. Everything is currently under construction.  Hoping to fully polish the site, before summer.  But for a start I decided to push my work and fix as I go.
