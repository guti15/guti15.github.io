	<!-- Hello, fellow techies I' am currently a Junior in college, in the mist of obtaining a bachelors degrees in Computer Science.  As a current student I'm  constantly found learning or meeting deadlines in projects and have discovered that I really enjoyed tinkering with computers in my spare time.  Some of the languages, that I have learned so far are C++ and Python.  As well as Mark-up languages like HTML along with it's friendly companion CSS.  There are many more languages, that I am currently striving to get a hold of, but for the mean time, I have developed a strong passion for the text editor EMACS.  It truly is a POWERFUL tool, and I am able to comprehend when  people say that it is similar to an OS.  It's functionality seem endless. As a Spanish speaker and currently studying natural language processing, I have came with the idea to develop my own version of tutorial for Emacs. While reasearching Natural Language Processign  I noticed that I truly enjoyed using my text editor because of it flexibility and ease to integrate to everything I was doing.  So decided to type up a small documentation of Emacs in Spanish. Done of course in Emacs itself. When I sensed the lack of information of this text editor in Spanish I felt obliged to spread the wealth of information. Everything is currently under construction.  Hoping to fully polish the site, before summer.  But for a start I decided to push my work and fix as I go.  -->

	Hello fellow techies! <p><br>

	I'm a recent College grad from  <a rel="link to College" href="http://wheatoncollege.edu/"><span style="color:#000">Wheaton College</span> </a> <!-- Wheaton College --> where I majored in Computer Science. At the moment working on some on going projects.  Begining to learn more android development (more particular NFC) as well as some JavaScript in order to make webpaged more animated. However, True enjoyment is when working with python.  Such an amazing language.  Some times finding myself trying to take the Python Challange. If you Love python and haven't taken it, I definitly recommend checking it out! Here's the <a rel="take the Challange!" href="http://www.pythonchallenge.com/"><span style="color:#2ecc71">link!</span> </a> Also have to admit I am a die hard fan of Emacs.  Love tweaking my .emacs file and tailoring it to my needs.
